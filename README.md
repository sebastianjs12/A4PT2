Assignment 4 Part 2
Note to grader (PLEASE READ)

After cloning from Git, please make sure to disable "Instant Run" on AndroidStudio, as this causes an error on some version of AndroidStudio.

File > Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment, > Instant Run

I had to use my own Android Phone as an emulator as my laptop was not capable of running the emulator. My screenshots do not show the app on top of my code as a result.

If you would prefer, I've recorded the activity of the app for easier review (this way you don't have to go through screenshots if you don't want to!)
